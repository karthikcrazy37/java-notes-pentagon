1. Prime number is a number which is multiplied by itself and by 1.
2. So we need a variable to store a number.
3. Then we need to check that number must only be multiplied by 1 and by itself.

This is an efficient way to write the Prime number
In previous Prime number we run the loop all the way to the entered number but actually
we can just check half the number because A number cannot have a divisor greater than half of itself
Except the number itself, which we are not checking. For Example
Take 29:

Half of 29 = 14

Any number greater than 14 (15–28) cannot divide 29

So checking beyond 29 / 2 is unnecessary

Another example (non-prime)

Take 12:

Half of 12 = 6

Divisors of 12 → 2, 3, 4, 6

All divisors are ≤ 12 / 2
